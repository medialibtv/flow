`[TASK] Handling script execution in _Resources <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/00b8c76b5e1673d49ca01cbd06d2bda76dd50a9f>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This change adds an .htaccess file to the installer defaults that will
be copied to Web/_Resources and switch off further .htaccess overrides,
disable PHP and make everything handled by he default-handler.

In addition the documentation explains the need for disallowing script
execution below Web/_Resources.

`[SECURITY] Fix potential XML External Entity Processing <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/bea24142ef25134cb6156568d6c26a58cfc14cb6>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MediaTypeConverter in Flow is potentially vulnerable to XXE (see
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing)

This change fixes that by disabling the external entity loader.

Thanks to Wouter Wolters for reporting this (original Reporter: Wouter
van Dongen).

`[BUGFIX] Set correct request port if X-Forwarded-Proto is set <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/120>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fixes an issue resulting in wrong rendered URLs if Flow is accepting
request from a load balancer or proxy which is accessed via https
externally, sends the X-Forwarded-Proto header to Nginx but does not
specify the X-Forwarded-Port header.

For example, a load balancer (for example Google HTTP/HTTPS load
balancer) is accessible via https and terminates SSL. The load balancer
communicates with Nginx via http on port 80. Google only sends the
X-Forwarded-Proto header ("https") but not the port. URLs, for example
in an action URI of a form, are rendered wrongly.

An expected URL would be https://example.com/foo.html, however, the
rendered URL is https://example.com:80/foo.html

This change changes the behavior in `Request` so that if the
X-Forwarded-Proto header is set, but the X-Forwarded-Port header isn't,
the port is set to the standard port of the given protocol (80 / 443).

`[TASK] Document issues with final SQLFilter constructor <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/116>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When implementing a Doctrine filter the proxy building of Flow can cause problems. This change documents this and explains a solution.

`[BUGFIX] Check if migrations exist before trying to register them <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/115>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Backport from 9823ae980e803 (Author: Laurent Cherpit @lcherpit )

Currently the check for the existence of migration files is delegated
to the doctrine/migration third party library.

The behavior has changed and an exception is thrown if the folder doesn't
exist. To not let the third party library handle that and to prevent this,
the check is done upstream in Flow.

`[BUGFIX] Make sure expired cache entries get deleted in PdoBackend <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/110>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`$this->has($entryIdentifier)` returns false for expired cache entries
which leads to duplicate key violations. Remove existing entries,
including expired ones, before creating new cache entry.

`[BUGFIX] Fix lookup path for \`\`AvailableProxyClasses.php\`\` <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/96>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since `2787b2a3216deb188c4cd1c9b2b823e6e3a10da3 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/2787b2a3216deb188c4cd1c9b2b823e6e3a10da3>`_ Flow creates a
map for available proxy classes stored in ``AvailableProxyClasses.php``
within the temporary directory.

The ``ClassLoader`` failed to include that file though when run in
a nested Application Context. That is fixed with this change.

`[BUGFIX] Initialize Router lazily <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/98>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Router should be able to initialize configured routes lazily
except when explicitly told not to do so.
This change allows the Router to get the configuration directly
from the ``ConfigurationManager`` if no other routing configuration
exists. If some routing configuration was set, this is used.

`[TASK] Remove use of deprecated apigen options <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/94>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The todo and deprecated options have been deprecated in favour of the
annotation-groups feature. This adjusts apigen.yml to comply.

`[TASK] Add apigen.yml <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/93>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This adds an apigen.yml file for use when generating API docs.

`[BUGFIX] Make ObjectAccess use TypeHandling (FLOW-397) <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/92>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This change adjusts ObjectAccess to use getTypeForValue() instead of
get_class() so Doctrine proxies are handled correctly.

`[BUGFIX] Fix functional test by explicitly naming sequence <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/78>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The auto-generated name of a sequence exceeds the maximum length, is
truncated and thus duplicates an already existing name in the schema.
This is solved by manually giving a name to the sequence.

This bug affects only PostgreSQL and is triggered by a functional test
fixture.

`[TASK] Update license headers <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/69>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This change updates license headers in all packages contained in the Flow Development Collection according to what has been discussed earlier: https://discuss.neos.io/t/rfc-license-header-file-doc-comment-change/517

`[BUGFIX] Class loader includes some files twice <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/38>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For some reason, the FLOW class loader includes some files twice.

This especially occurs when a Composer dependency declares an autoload file that contains function definitions (one example for a package like that being `guzzlehttp/promises`).

This commit fixes this issue by replacing `include` with `include_once`.

`[TASK] Apply MIT license to the Flow framework <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/52>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This change adjusts all file headers to state the code is under the MIT
license now. It removes the use of the name TYPO3 in comments along the
way.

Our reasoning for the license change has been explained at
 https://www.neos.io/news/why-mit-license-for-flow-makes-sense.html
and the TYPO3 Association has published the decision at
 http://typo3.org/news/article/the-neos-team-and-the-typo3-association-sign-agreement/

With this change, the need for a CLA is gone.

`[TASK] Add Code of Conduct <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/45>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This adds a reStructuredText version of the Contributor Covenant
code of conduct, to make it clear the project is governed by that.

`[TASK] Add Readme.rst files for individual packages <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/47>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This adds a Readme.rst to each package, so that the read-only subplit
repositories have a readme file for GitHub to show and for the users
to read.

`[BUGFIX] Remove neos composer plugin from reflection <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/39>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As Flow 2.3 still uses a blacklist approach for reflection and proxybuilding the neos composer plugin needs to be excluded instead of the composer installers package.

`[BUGFIX] SecurityContext does not inject SessionManagerInterface <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/22>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In TYPO3/Flow/Security/Context class SessionManagerInterface should be injected
to follow the Objects configuration. This breaks projects where a custom
SessionManager is implemented and switched using Objects configuration.

However in the Unit test for security context SessionManagerInterface is mocked.

PS: This issue is already handled in Flow 3.0 so need a HotFix for 2.3

`[TASK] Allow InstallerScripts to work with collection repository <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/36>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The InstallerScripts taking care of copying distribution resources
after composer operations would assume package paths that are
incompatible with the joined repositories. This will result in
missing Neos Routes on installing from the collection repository.

This is a first step after which the joined composer.json can be
used fully.

This deprecates the ["extras"]["typo3/flow"]["manage-resources"]
configuration for copying distribution resources. The deprecation
is in effect from 3.1 onwards and this option will be removed
three versions later. The new
["extras"]["neos"]["installer-resource-folders"] configuration
which is an array of directories containing installer resources
superseeds it with this changes and takes precedence. A typical
replacement would be:

  "installer-resource-folders": ["Resources/Private/Installer/"]
